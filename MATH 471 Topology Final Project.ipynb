    "Topological Data Analysis (TDA) applies techniques from algebraic topology to study and extract topological and geometric information on the shape of data \\[1\\]. By considering geometric and topological features of multi-dimensional data arising from various distance metrics imposed on the data, complex relationships within the data can be preserved and jointly considered. This often leads to better results than using standard analytical tools. This project then aims at harnessing the power of TDA for machine learning. We can combine and compare a wide range of TDA techniques to extract features from images that are usually used separately. This project will introduce several topological preliminary background, especially cubical complexes and their persistent homology which is much more natural for images with 'cube' pixels. Then, for the first part, I discover the shape of the data by the mapper algorithm\\[2\\]. Visualising and understanding very high dimensional datasets is vital for further understanding more about the nature, fundamental structure and underlying relationships of the data and preparing the data for machine learning algorithms as the preprocess for classifying tasks. Second, This project presents a more general way to use TDA for machine learning tasks on grayscale images by applying various TDA techniques \\[3\\]. Specifically, this project applies persistent homology to generate a wide range of topological features using a point cloud obtained from an image, its natural grayscale filtration, and different filtrations defined on the binarized image. We show that this topological machine learning pipeline can be used as a highly relevant dimensionality reduction by applying it to the MNIST digits dataset. For the result, we can observe that the trained classifier can classify digit images while reducing the size of the feature set by more than half in comparison with the grayscale pixel value features and maintain similar even higher accuracy as 97%.

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will introduce the preliminary mathematical background of my topic. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) applies techniques from algebraic topology to study and extract topological and geometric information on the ***shape*** of data \\[1\\]. In this project, I use persistent homology, a tool from TDA that extracts features representing the numbers of connected components, cycles, and voids and their birth and death during an iterative process called a filtration \\[4\\]. Each of those features is summarized as a point in a persistence diagram. Most commonly used on point clouds, persistent homology can also be used on images, using their voxel structure \\[3\\]. The mathematical background will be introduced from below.\n",

    "A **metric** on a set $M$ is a function $d: M \\times M \\rightarrow[0, \\infty),$ where $[0, \\infty)$ denotes the set of non-negative real numbers. It is required that, for any points $x, y, z$ in $M, d(x, y)=d(y, x)$ $d(x, x)=0,$ and $d(x, z) \\leq d(x, y)+d(y, z) .$ A metric on $M$ thus provides a way to measure distances between points of $M$ and we refer to the pair $(M, d)$ as a **metric space**. In TDA the initial input is given by a dataset with a chosen metric on its points. We refer to such inputs also as **point clouds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a point cloud is distributed unevenly, geometric structures called **simplicial complexes** derived from the data can yield important information about dataset's structure. Given a dataset $M,$ a simplicial complex on $M$ is a collection of non-empty subsets of $M,$ called **simplices**, such that any subset of a simplex is also a simplex. A k-simplex $\\sigma$ is the convex hull of $k + 1$ affinely independent points shown in the figure below. A 0-simplex is also called a vertex and a 1-simplex an edge. A finite simplicial complex is a finite collection of simplices satisfying some conditions. Its dimension is the maximal dimension of its simplices.\n",

    "In imagery, the standard sampling of an image is achieved via a cubic tessellation. In 2D image case, this leads to a 2D image array. If we associate each entry of the array with a unit square with vertices in an integer lattice, we obtain a complex of unit squares commonly called **pixels**. Any two pixels are either disjoint or intersect through a common edge or a common vertex. This complex is called a 2D cubical complex. If the squares are represented geometrically in the plane, the representation is called the geometric realization of the cubical complexin the plane. The simplicial theory would require subdividing each pixel into union of two triangles and hence increasing the complexity of data. But the approach using **cubical theory will deal directly with this cubical structure**. The same observations can be made for 3D images which lead to a 3D-cubical complexof voxels.\n",

    "**Mapper** is a combination of dimensionality reduction, clustering and graph networks techniques used to get higher level understanding of the structure of data. For my understanding, it is mainly used for, visualising the shape of data through a particular lens, detecting clusters and interesting topological structures which traditional methods fail to find, and selecting features that best discriminate data and for model interpretability.\\[2\\]."

    "Mapper models data as a graph by refining standard clustering algorithms with topological ideas. Namely, global clustering of the data may be inefficient, especially when the data’s distance metric is not Euclidean. Instead, data is partitioned according to some intervals of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. These intervals are created by using a **filter function** $f$ meaning a function on data under which each point has exactly one value on some interval. Then, **local clustering** is achieved based on those datapoints which map to the same interval. The clusters make nodes of the Mapper graph. Intervals are overlapping by some predefined amount. Clusters with non-empty intersection of points mapping to the overlap of two adjacent intervals are then joined by an edge in the graph. If three or more\n",
    "clusters of points have non-empty intersection mapping to the same overlap of intervals,\n",
    "2- and higher simplices can become present in the Mapper graph. The Mapper construction thus creates a simplicial complex of clusters representing the structure of data under the chosen filtering function. This modification to standard clustering gives more insight into the global structure of data through simplicial constructions as explained above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining together, given a dataset of points, the basic steps behind Mapper are as follows:\n",
    "1. Map to a lower-dimensional space using a filter function $f,$ or lens. Common choices for the filter function include projection onto one or more axes via principal component analysis (PCA) or density-based methods.\n",
    "2. Construct a cover $\\left(U_{i}\\right)_{i \\in I}$ of the projected space typically in the form of a set of overlapping intervals which have constant length.\n",
    "3. For each interval $U_{i}$ cluster the points in the preimage $f^{-1}\\left(U_{i}\\right)$ into sets $C_{i, 1}, \\ldots, C_{i, k_{i}}$\n",
    "4. Construct the graph whose vertices are the cluster sets and an edge exists between two vertices if two clusters share some points in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a compressed graph representation of the dataset representing well its structure. High flexibility is left in this procedure to the data scientist for fine tuning: the choice of the lens, the cover and the clustering algorithm. The figure below gives a simple example of Mapper algorithm illustrated above.\n",

    "Filtrations of cubical complexes are built from binary images consisting of only black and white pixels, so the first step is to convert greyscale images to binary by applying a threshold on each pixel value via the Binarizer transformer provided by [giotto-tda](https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs/latest/library.html) library in Python. The example of the binary image of ”0“ in the train set is shown below."

    "This project combined a wide range of different TDA techniques for images based on different filtrations and diagram features. This project shows that machine learning algorithms feeded by features generated by TDA techniques are able to classify MNIST digits using half less features than the pixel values, while maintaining the accuracy. As a result, TDA techniques provide powerful dimensionality reduction algorithms for images. Combining machine learning and TDA into a generic pipeline which gathers a wide range of TDA techniques was shown to be a powerful approach to understand the underlying characteristic shapes on the images of a dataset, especially using height, radial, and our density filtrations. Moreover, one can easily validate and support one’s choice of topological features for novel datasets as well.\n",
